		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
			The goal of Menu Simulator 2K17 is to train your Link to the Past menuing skills by
			training your brain to find the optimal path between two items and
			training your hands to execute it as quickly as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Items are randomly chosen to be placed on the menu, with some items
			e.g., bombs and bottles appearing more often,
			simply because there are more chances to find them when actually playing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your current selection is indicated with a green circle,
			and your target is indicated with two green rings.
		</p>
		<p>
			To confirm your selection, press <tt>START</tt>.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Game modes</h2>
		<h3>Study</h3>
		<p>
			In Study, you are given a brief period of time to study the layout of the menu before playing a round.
		</p>
		<h3>Blitz</h3>
		<p>
			In Blitz, the layout of the menu changes every time.
		</p>
		<h3>Collections</h3>
		<p>
			In Collections, you start with 4 random items and gain more as the round increases.
			It's like playing randomizer, but without all the boring stuff. Just good ol' menuing.
