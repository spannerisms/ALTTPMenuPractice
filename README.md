# ALTTPMenuPractice

Requires [JInput](https://github.com/jinput/jinput) libraries to be installed in your JRE. See [/libsetup](https://github.com/fatmanspanda/ALTTPMenuPractice/tree/master/libsetup) for necessary files and a program that writes them automatically (requires running from command line as an administrator).

Files can be manually copied to your JRE's bin folder. If you don't know where that is, run the main GUI, and it will tell you where to place them.
